# Zman
A simple CLI Zmanim tool powered by Hebcal.

## Features
- Zmanim and events (holidays, fasts, etc.) for any day at any location.
    - All zmanim provided in the hebcal API plus candle lighting are available 
    - Candle lighting calculated based on a custom variable allowing for 18 min, 40 min or any other period.
        - Automatic switching between 18 and 40 min candle lighting based on location (in development)

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to an appropriate location and cd into the resulting directory
``` {bash}
git clone https://github.com/onegkg/Zman.git
cd Zman
```
2. Install using pip
``` {bash}
pip install .
```
3. Before using zman, you'll need to create a geonames.org api key. this is a free service that is used to convert plain text place names to a unique identifier that can be used in the hebcal API
    1. Create a free [geonames.org](https://www.geonames.org/login) account.
    2. Once you've created your account, navigate to your account page and turn on "Free Web Services" for your account.
    3. Create a `config.yaml` file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zman/` (if you run zman without a config file, it will tell you where to put the config file) and add your geonames user name under `APIs -> geonames_key`. A sample minimal config.yaml file is provided under [Sample Config](#sample-config)

## Usage
- `zman` gives you the zmanim for the current day at the location from your config.

- `zman -d` or `zman --date`allows you to get the zmanim on a particular date. The date should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD

- `zman -l` or `zman --location` allows you to get the zmanim in a particular location.

- `zman -h` prints the help message.

## Configuration
### Sample Config
Configuration is done in a `config.yaml` file, which should be placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zman/config.yaml`. A minimal sample config is provided below.
``` {yaml}
APIs:
  geonames_key: "<your_geonames_username>" 

Settings:
  location: "Boston, MA" 
```
### Full Configuration
Below is the full `default_config.yaml`, any of these options can be overriden by the user in `config.yaml`. 
#### Zmanim
These are are all of the zmanim that are provided by the Hebcal API, I've set sane defaults, but you are welcome to change any of them that you would like. Zmanim with MGA and numbers in their names may have their names formatted weirdly, this is unintentional and will probably be fixed at some point.
